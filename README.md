# TicTacToe
This was my first C# Code in Visual Studios. It took me an hour to set it up because VS did not like me. The code took quite awhile since I was learning based of the internet and their methods. It was a good thing I knew C++ so things were familiar. Things I learned: Syntax of C#, Logic/Conditionals, Variables, Arrays, Functions, and much more. It was very fun making it as I was racing a friends to see who could code a Tic Tac Toe program faster. He used C++, which is a much easier language. In the end, it was a draw. I would use C++, but I want to get familiar with C# so I can code my own Windows 10 Apps.
